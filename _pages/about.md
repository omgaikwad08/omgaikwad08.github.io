**Welcome to my Portfolio!**

Thank you for stopping by to explore my journey in robotics.

I’m **Om**, a dedicated **Robotics Systems Engineer** currently working full-time at **Celltrio** in Fremont, CA. My role centers on **elevating the reliability of robotic systems** by developing automated testing scripts with state machines, diagnosing hardware/software issues, and enhancing overall system functionality.


I hold a **Master's in Robotics Engineering** from **Worcester Polytechnic Institute** (WPI). During my studies, I focused on: 
- **Motion Planning** 
- **Deep Learning** 
- **Advanced Robot Navigation** 
- **Robot Control**
