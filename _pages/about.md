**Welcome to my Portfolio!**

Thank you for stopping by and exploring my journey in robotics.

I am currently working full-time as a Robotics Systems Engineer at <a href = "https://celltrio.com/"> Celltrio </a> in Fremont, CA. My role centers on **elevating the reliability of robotic systems** by developing automated testing scripts with state machines, diagnosing HW/SW issues, and enhancing overall system functionality.

I have completed my Masters in Robotics Engineering from the <a href = "https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering"> Worcester Polytechnic Institute </a>. I have had the opportunity to purse courses in Motion Planning, Deep Learning, Advanced Robot Navigation & Robot Control further I did my research in Depth Image Enhancement where I worked on developing Image Enhancement algorithms to enhance Robotic Grasping at the  <a href = "https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/" > MER Lab </a>.
