`Welcome to my Portfolio`! 👋🏻

Thank you for stopping by to explore my journey in robotics.
 
I'm presently working full-time as Robotics Systems Engineer at <a href="https://celltrio.com/">`Celltrio Inc.`</a> My role focuses on developing automated State-Machine based test scripts to evaluate reliability of Robotic Systems, which invovles diagnosing HW/SW issues creating test reports and performing modular tests.

## 🎓 Educational Background
I hold a Master's Degree in Robotics Engineering from <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">`Worcester Polytechnic Institute `</a> where I had the opportunity to dive deep in to core robotics concepts and develop hands-on projects in the following fields:
- 📍 Motion Planning
- 📐 State Estimatation 
- 🧠 Deep Learning
- 🤖 Advanced Robot Navigation
- 🕹️ Robot Control

## 💡 Research Spotlight
At WPI's <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/">`MER Lab`</a> I conducted research in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/om-vinayak-gaikwad-b06a4a1a4/overlay/experience/2339573014/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAC_aRbYBvALUhp7L2HHVMZ0iNiKesxLoLG0&treasuryMediaId=1708129364396">`Depth Image Enhancement`</a>, developing algorithms to improve robotic grasping accuracy—a critical advancement in real-world robotic applications!
